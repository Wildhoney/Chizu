When the `handler` prop of the `Error` component is invoked we need to pass the context to it which should consist of the `Set<Task>` so that the user can programmatically disable all of the in-flight actions for things like `403` or `500` to prevent other errors bubbling up &ndash; that way a recovery can be attempted such as a sign in, after which a distributed action can be sent such as the user is re-authenticated and the normal flow can resume.
